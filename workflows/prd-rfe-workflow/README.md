# PRD & RFE Creation Workflow for Ambient Code Platform

A comprehensive workflow for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and systematically breaking them down into actionable Request for Enhancement (RFE) items. Guides product teams through the complete product definition lifecycle from discovery to implementation roadmap.

## Overview

This workflow provides a structured approach to product requirements and feature planning:
- **Discovery-Driven Process**: Six-phase methodology from discovery to prioritization
- **Requirements Excellence**: Emphasizes clear, testable, and measurable requirements
- **Structured Breakdown**: Systematic decomposition of PRDs into implementable RFEs
- **Agent Collaboration**: Leverages specialized product and technical agents

### Workflow Phases

The PRD-RFE Workflow follows a systematic 6-phase approach:

#### Phase 1: Discovery (`/prd.discover`)
**Purpose**: Conduct product discovery to understand the problem space and user needs

- Define the problem statement
- Research target users and their pain points
- Analyze competitive landscape and market opportunity
- Propose high-level solution concepts
- Define success metrics
- Document open questions and assumptions

**Output**: `artifacts/discovery.md`

**When to use**: Start here when exploring a new product idea or feature concept

**Agent Recommendation**: Invoke **Quinn (Product Strategist)** for strategic product discovery, market analysis, and vision development

#### Phase 2: Requirements (`/prd.requirements`)
**Purpose**: Gather and document detailed product requirements

- Transform user needs into specific requirements
- Write user stories with acceptance criteria
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Document constraints and dependencies
- Prioritize requirements (MoSCoW)
- Identify what's in scope and out of scope

**Output**: `artifacts/requirements.md`

**When to use**: After discovery phase, or jump here if you have a well-defined problem

**Agent Recommendation**: Invoke **Bailey (Business Analyst)** for requirements elicitation, acceptance criteria definition, and stakeholder alignment

#### Phase 3: Create PRD (`/prd.create`)
**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document

- Generate complete PRD from discovery and requirements
- Write executive summary and product vision
- Document goals, success metrics, and KPIs
- Define target users and personas
- Create detailed user stories and use cases
- Specify functional and non-functional requirements
- Define scope, assumptions, dependencies, and risks
- Validate PRD quality and completeness

**Output**:
- `artifacts/prd.md`
- `artifacts/prd-checklist.md`

**When to use**: After requirements gathering phase

**Agent Recommendations**:
- **Quinn (Product Strategist)** for strategic sections (vision, market positioning)
- **Bailey (Business Analyst)** for requirements sections
- **Morgan (Technical Writer)** for documentation quality review

#### Phase 4: RFE Breakdown (`/rfe.breakdown`)
**Purpose**: Break down the PRD into actionable Request for Enhancement items

- Analyze PRD for discrete, implementable units of work
- Create RFE master list with overview and summary
- Generate individual RFE documents with detailed specifications
- Define acceptance criteria for each RFE
- Identify dependencies between RFEs
- Size RFEs (Small/Medium/Large/XLarge)
- Create dependency graph and sequencing plan
- Validate completeness and traceability

**Output**:
- `artifacts/rfes.md` (Master RFE list)
- `artifacts/rfe-tasks/RFE-XXX-*.md` (Individual RFE documents)

**When to use**: After PRD creation and approval

**Agent Recommendation**: Invoke **Riley (Product Owner)** for breaking PRDs into RFEs, defining acceptance criteria, and managing dependencies

#### Phase 5: Prioritization (`/rfe.prioritize`)
**Purpose**: Prioritize RFEs and create implementation roadmap

- Apply prioritization framework (MoSCoW, RICE, Value vs Effort)
- Score and rank RFEs based on business value
- Create implementation roadmap with phases/releases
- Define dependency-driven sequence
- Perform risk-adjusted prioritization
- Map RFEs to business goals and user needs
- Generate recommendations for implementation order

**Output**:
- `artifacts/prioritization.md`
- `artifacts/roadmap-visual.md` (optional)

**When to use**: After RFE breakdown is complete

**Agent Recommendation**: Invoke **Riley (Product Owner)** for prioritization strategy and roadmap planning

#### Phase 6: Review (`/review`)
**Purpose**: Review all artifacts and validate completeness and quality

- Scan all generated artifacts for completeness
- Perform quality assessment (PRD, RFEs, prioritization)
- Create traceability matrix (PRD requirements → RFEs)
- Calculate quality scores and metrics
- Identify issues, gaps, and recommendations
- Assess readiness for stakeholder review and implementation
- Generate comprehensive review report

**Output**: `artifacts/review-report.md`

**When to use**: After all phases are complete, before stakeholder review

**Agent Recommendation**: Invoke **Morgan (Technical Writer)** for documentation quality review and clarity improvements

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Create an AgenticSession** in the Ambient Code Platform
2. **Select "PRD & RFE Creation"** from the workflows dropdown
3. **Start with `/prd.discover`** to begin product discovery
4. **Follow the phases** sequentially or jump to any phase based on your context

### Example Usage

**Scenario 1: New product idea**
```
User: "We want to add a user analytics dashboard to help users track their usage patterns"

Workflow: /prd.discover to understand the problem and opportunity
→ /prd.requirements to gather detailed requirements
→ /prd.create to generate comprehensive PRD
→ /rfe.breakdown to create implementable RFEs
→ /rfe.prioritize to plan implementation roadmap
→ /review to validate quality
```

**Scenario 2: You already have requirements**
```
User: "I have detailed requirements for a new reporting feature"

Workflow: Jump to /prd.create to generate PRD
→ /rfe.breakdown to create RFEs
→ /rfe.prioritize to plan roadmap
→ /review to validate
```

**Scenario 3: You have a PRD and need RFEs**
```
User: "I have a complete PRD for our mobile app redesign and need to break it into RFEs"

Workflow: Jump to /rfe.breakdown to decompose into RFEs
→ /rfe.prioritize to plan implementation
→ /review to validate coverage
```

### Prerequisites

- Clear understanding of the problem or product opportunity
- Access to user research, market data, or competitive analysis (helpful but not required)
- Stakeholder alignment on business goals and success metrics
- Understanding of technical constraints and dependencies (for RFE breakdown)

## Agent Orchestration

Agent collaboration is automatically triggered when you use the workflow commands—specialized agents are orchestrated as needed to ensure high-quality product documentation. Additionally, you can bring any individual agent into a conversation at any point by typing the '@' symbol and selecting an agent by name.

## Best Practices

### Discovery
- Focus on understanding the problem before jumping to solutions
- Validate assumptions with user research and data
- Document what you don't know
- Identify risks and constraints early

### Requirements
- Make every requirement testable and measurable
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Define acceptance criteria upfront
- Document assumptions and dependencies
- Clearly define what's in scope and out of scope

### PRD Creation
- Write for your audience (executives, stakeholders, technical teams)
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Use measurable success metrics
- Include visual aids (tables, diagrams) where helpful
- Keep technical implementation details out of the PRD

### RFE Breakdown
- Each RFE should be independently valuable and deliverable
- Size RFEs appropriately (not too large, not too small)
- Define clear acceptance criteria for every RFE
- Ensure traceability back to PRD requirements
- Identify and document dependencies clearly

### Prioritization
- Prioritize based on business value and user impact
- Consider dependencies and risks
- Each roadmap phase should deliver cohesive value
- Be transparent about trade-offs and what's deferred
- Align priorities with business goals

### Review
- Check traceability from PRD to RFEs
- Validate completeness and quality
- Look for gaps, contradictions, and ambiguities
- Ensure documentation is stakeholder-ready
- Address critical issues before implementation

- Engage Bailey (Business Analyst) for requirements elicitation
- Ask clarifying questions to stakeholders
- Document assumptions and validate with users

**"RFEs are too large or too small"**
- Review RFE breakdown principles in `/rfe.breakdown`
- Engage Riley (Product Owner) for proper decomposition
- Consider dependencies and team capacity
- Aim for RFEs in the 2-10 day range

**"Priorities are unclear or conflicting"**
- Revisit business goals and success metrics in PRD
- Use multiple prioritization frameworks to triangulate
- Engage stakeholders to resolve conflicts
- Document trade-offs and rationale

**"Requirements aren't traceable to RFEs"**
- Run `/review` to generate traceability matrix
- Fill gaps by creating missing RFEs
- Consolidate or split RFEs as needed
- Update PRD if requirements changed
