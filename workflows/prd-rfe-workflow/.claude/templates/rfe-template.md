# RFE Template - Red Hat Format

This template provides a standardized format for creating Request for Enhancement (RFE) documents that conform to Red Hat's RFE structure. Use this template when generating individual RFE files.

## Template Structure

```markdown
# RFE-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Size**: [S/M/L/XL]
**Created**: [Date]
**PRD Reference**: [Link to prd.md section]

## Summary

[One to three sentences describing the enhancement. Should clearly state what is being extended, added, or modified, and who benefits from this change. Focus on the value delivered.]

Example: "Extend the [component/feature] to [action], providing [target users] with [benefit/value]."

## Background

[Describe the current state of the system/feature. Explain what exists today and what limitations or gaps exist. Reference any relevant existing functionality.]

### Current State
- [Current feature/component description]
- [What information/functionality is currently available]
- [Existing user workflows]

### Gaps and Limitations
- [What is missing or insufficient]
- [What users cannot currently see/do]
- [Pain points with current implementation]

### Related Documentation
- [Links to refinement docs, brainstorming sessions, UXD diagrams, etc.]
- [Reference to related PRDs, user research, or technical specifications]

## Problem Statement

[Clearly articulate the problem(s) this RFE addresses. Focus on user pain points and business impact. Use specific, measurable language when possible.]

[Target User Persona] needs [capability/visibility/functionality] because [reason/impact]. The current [system/UI/feature] provides no indication of:

- [Problem 1]: [Description]
- [Problem 2]: [Description]

- 🔵 **[Status Name]**: [Meaning and when it appears]
- 🟠 **[Status Name]**: [Meaning and when it appears]
- ⚫ **[Status Name]**: [Meaning and when it appears]

#### Detailed View Enhancements
- **[Feature Name]**: [Description]
  - [What information is shown]
  - [How users interact with it]
  - [What actions are available]

### Technical Approach (High-Level)

[Brief technical overview - can be refined during implementation]

#### Integration Points
- [System/Component 1]: [How it integrates]
- [System/Component 2]: [How it integrates]

#### Data Considerations
- [Data models or migrations needed]
- [API endpoints or services required]
- [Caching or performance considerations]

## User Stories

[Organize user stories by persona or role. Use the standard format: "As a [persona], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."]

### As a [Persona 1]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]

### As a [Persona 2]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]

### As a [Persona 3]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]
- I want to [action] so that [benefit]

## Usage Guidelines

When generating RFEs using this template:

1. **Summary**: Keep it concise (1-3 sentences). Focus on what's being extended/added and who benefits.

2. **Background**: Provide context about current state and gaps. Reference existing documentation when available.

3. **Problem Statement**: Be specific about pain points. Use measurable language when possible.

4. **Proposed Solution**: Focus on WHAT, not HOW. Technical details belong in Technical Approach section.

5. **User Stories**: Organize by persona. Each story should clearly state the goal and benefit.

6. **Acceptance Criteria**: Must be testable and measurable. Use specific, unambiguous language.

7. **Success Criteria**: Should align with problem statement and be measurable.

8. **Adapt as Needed**: Not all sections are required for every RFE. Omit sections that don't apply, but maintain the overall structure.

## Extensions

This template can be extended with additional sections as needed:

- **Design Mockups**: Links to Figma, Miro, or design artifacts
- **API Specifications**: If the RFE involves API changes
- **Database Schema**: If data model changes are required
- **Migration Plan**: If existing data needs to be migrated
- **Rollout Strategy**: If phased rollout is planned
- **Monitoring & Observability**: What metrics/logs will be added
