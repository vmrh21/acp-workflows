## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

This command reviews PRD artifacts (discovery, requirements, and PRD documents) for completeness across critical product discovery categories.

**IMPORTANT: Agent Collaboration**

You MUST proactively invoke the following collaborating agents to ensure comprehensive PRD review:

1. **@steve-ux_designer.md** - For UX assessment and to determine if a prototype is needed for validation
2. **@aria-ux_architect.md** (from bullpen) - For holistic UX strategy validation and journey alignment
3. **@olivia-product_owner.md** (from bullpen) - For story readiness and acceptance criteria validation
4. **@archie-architect.md** (from bullpen) - For technical feasibility and architecture alignment

Invoke these agents at the start of the review process. Work collaboratively with them to assess quality, completeness, and feasibility from multiple perspectives.

1. **Load PRD Artifacts**:
   - Read `discovery.md` (if exists)
   - Read `requirements.md` (if exists)
   - Read `prd.md` (required)
   - Consider user input from $ARGUMENTS

2. **Create PRD Review Report**: Generate `prd-review-report.md`:

3. **Perform Detailed Analysis**:

   For each category, systematically search through all PRD artifacts:

   - **Product/Feature Definition**: Look for product vision, feature descriptions, value proposition
   - **Core Problem**: Search for problem statement, user pain points, catalyst/trigger
   - **Target Users**: Find personas, user roles, demographics, market size
   - **Business Goals**: Identify objectives, success definitions, KPIs, metrics
   - **Competitive Landscape**: Look for competitor analysis, alternatives, differentiation strategy
   - **Constraints**: Find timeline, budget, technical, regulatory, or other limitations

4. **Score Each Question**:
   - Give 1 point for ✅ Complete
   - Give 0.5 points for ⚠️ Partial
   - Give 0 points for ❌ Missing
   - Calculate percentage score

5. **Identify Gaps**:
   - List what information is missing or incomplete
   - Prioritize gaps by impact (High/Medium/Low)
   - Provide specific recommendations for addressing each gap

6. **Assess Readiness**:
   - Determine if PRD is ready for RFE breakdown
   - Score threshold: >80% = Ready, 60-80% = Needs Minor Revisions, <60% = Needs Major Revisions
   - Provide clear next steps

7. **Report Findings**:
   - Display completeness score
   - Highlight critical gaps
   - List strengths
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - State readiness for next phase

8. **Interactive Follow-up**:
   - If gaps found, ask if user wants to address them now
   - Suggest which commands to re-run (e.g., `/prd.discover`, `/prd.requirements`, `/prd.create`)
   - Offer to help fill specific gaps

## Guidelines

- Focus on completeness, not perfection
- Be specific about what's missing and where to add it
- Prioritize gaps by business impact
- Check all artifacts (discovery, requirements, PRD) for information
- Cross-reference between documents
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback
- Recognize what's well-documented
- Make clear recommendations for next steps
