## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

This command helps prioritize RFEs and creates an implementation roadmap. It should be run after `/rfe.breakdown`.

**IMPORTANT: Agent Collaboration**

You MUST proactively invoke the following collaborating agents to ensure comprehensive RFE prioritization:

1. **@parker-product_manager.md** - For RICE scoring, business value assessment, ROI analysis, and market strategy alignment
2. **@olivia-product_owner.md** (from bullpen) - For backlog prioritization, MoSCoW categorization, and value vs effort analysis
3. **@emma-engineering_manager.md** (from bullpen) - For team capacity considerations, resource constraints, and delivery timeline planning

Invoke these agents at the start of the prioritization process. Work collaboratively with them to apply prioritization frameworks, assess business value, and create a realistic implementation roadmap.

1. **Load Context**:
   - Read `rfes.md`
   - Read `prd.md` for business goals and success metrics
   - Consider user input from $ARGUMENTS for prioritization criteria

2. **Gather Prioritization Input**:
   - Ask user about prioritization approach (if not specified in $ARGUMENTS):
     - **MoSCoW**: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
     - **RICE**: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
     - **Value vs. Effort**: 2x2 matrix
     - **Kano Model**: Basic, Performance, Excitement features
   - Ask about any constraints (deadlines, resource limits, dependencies)

3. **Apply Prioritization Framework**:

   ### MoSCoW Method
   Categorize each RFE:
   - **Must Have**: Critical for launch, non-negotiable
   - **Should Have**: Important but not critical
   - **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
   - **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this release

   ### RICE Scoring (if selected)
   For each RFE, score:
   - **Reach**: How many users affected? (per time period)
   - **Impact**: How much does it impact each user? (0.25=minimal, 0.5=low, 1=medium, 2=high, 3=massive)
   - **Confidence**: How confident are we? (percentage: 100%, 80%, 50%)
   - **Effort**: How much work? (person-months)
   - **RICE Score** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

   ### Value vs. Effort Matrix (if selected)
   Plot each RFE on 2x2 grid:
   - **Quick Wins**: High value, low effort (do first)
   - **Big Bets**: High value, high effort (plan carefully)
   - **Fill-ins**: Low value, low effort (do if time permits)
   - **Money Pit**: Low value, high effort (avoid/defer)

4. **Create Prioritization Document**: Generate `prioritization.md`:

   ```markdown
   # RFE Prioritization & Roadmap

   **Source**: [Link to rfes.md]
   **Date**: [Current Date]
   **Prioritization Method**: [MoSCoW/RICE/Value-Effort/Custom]

   ## Prioritization Summary

   | Priority | Count | RFE IDs |
   |----------|-------|---------|
   | Must Have / High | X | RFE-001, RFE-003, RFE-005 |
   | Should Have / Medium | X | RFE-002, RFE-004 |
   | Could Have / Low | X | RFE-006, RFE-007 |

   ## Prioritization Details

   ### Must Have / High Priority

   #### RFE-001: [Title]
   - **Priority Rationale**: [Why this is must-have]
   - **Business Value**: [What business value it delivers]
   - **User Impact**: [How it affects users]
   - **Dependencies**: [What depends on this]
   - **Estimated Effort**: [Size]
   - **Target Release**: [Release/Phase]

   [Repeat for each high-priority RFE]

   ### Should Have / Medium Priority

   [Similar structure]

   ### Could Have / Low Priority

   [Similar structure]

   ## RICE Scoring (if applicable)

   | RFE ID | Title | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score | Priority |
   |--------|-------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
   | RFE-001 | [Title] | 1000 | 2 | 80% | 2 | 800 | High |
   | RFE-002 | [Title] | 500 | 1 | 100% | 1 | 500 | Medium |

   ## Value vs. Effort Matrix (if applicable)

   ```
   High Value
   │
   │  Big Bets        Quick Wins
   │  [RFE-004]       [RFE-001, RFE-003]

   ## Implementation Roadmap

   ### Phase 1: MVP / Foundation (Release 1.0)
   **Goal**: [What this phase achieves]
   **Duration**: [Estimated timeline]

   #### Included RFEs
   - RFE-001: [Title] - [Estimated effort]
   - RFE-002: [Title] - [Estimated effort]

   **Phase Total**: [Total effort]
   **Key Deliverables**: [What users get]
   **Success Metrics**: [How we measure success]

   ### Phase 2: Core Features (Release 1.1)
   [Similar structure]

   ### Phase 3: Enhancements (Release 1.2)
   [Similar structure]

   ### Future Considerations (Backlog)
   - RFE-XXX: [Title] - [Why deferred]

   ## Dependency-Driven Sequence

   **Critical Path**:
   1. RFE-001 (Foundation) →
   2. RFE-003 (Depends on 001) →
   3. RFE-005 (Depends on 003)

   **Parallel Work Streams**:
   - **Stream A**: RFE-001 → RFE-003 → RFE-005
   - **Stream B**: RFE-002 → RFE-004 (can run in parallel)

   ## Risk-Adjusted Priority

   | RFE ID | Base Priority | Risk Level | Adjusted Priority | Rationale |
   |--------|---------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
   | RFE-001 | High | Low | High | Safe to proceed |
   | RFE-004 | High | High | Medium | De-risk before committing |

   ## Trade-off Analysis

   ### If Timeline is Constrained
   **Recommended**: RFE-001, RFE-003 (Quick Wins)
   **Defer**: RFE-004, RFE-007 (Big Bets, Money Pit)

   ### If Resources are Constrained
   **Recommended**: Focus on Must-Have items only
   **Defer**: All Should-Have and Could-Have to Phase 2

   ## Stakeholder Alignment

   ### Business Goals Mapping
   - **Goal 1: [Business Goal]**
     - Supported by: RFE-001, RFE-003
   - **Goal 2: [Business Goal]**
     - Supported by: RFE-002, RFE-004

   ### User Needs Mapping
   - **User Need 1: [Need]**
     - Addressed by: RFE-001, RFE-005
   - **User Need 2: [Need]**
     - Addressed by: RFE-002

   ## Recommendations

   1. **Start with Phase 1 RFEs**: [List and rationale]
   2. **Parallel work**: [Which RFEs can be done in parallel]
   3. **Key dependencies**: [Critical path items]
   4. **Risk mitigation**: [High-risk items to address early]

   ## Next Steps

   - [ ] Review prioritization with stakeholders
   - [ ] Confirm roadmap phases
   - [ ] Begin implementation planning for Phase 1
   - [ ] Create detailed task breakdown for high-priority RFEs
   ```

5. **Validate Prioritization**:
   - Priorities align with business goals from PRD
   - Dependencies are respected in roadmap
   - Each phase delivers cohesive value
   - Effort estimates are realistic
   - Risks are identified and addressed

6. **Create Visual Roadmap** (optional): Generate `roadmap-visual.md`:

   ```markdown
   # Visual Roadmap

   ## Timeline View

   ```
   Q1 2024          Q2 2024          Q3 2024
   ───────────────────────────────────────────
   Phase 1 MVP      Phase 2 Core     Phase 3
   │                │                │
   ├─ RFE-001 ─────┤                │
   ├─ RFE-002 ──────────────────────┤
   │  RFE-003 ──────┤                │
   │                └─ RFE-004 ──────┤
   │                   RFE-005 ──────┤
   ```

   ## Cumulative Value Delivery

   ```
   Value
   │        ╱─────

    P1   P2   P3
   ```
   ```

7. **Report Completion**:
   - Path to prioritization document
   - Summary of prioritization approach
   - Recommended implementation sequence
   - Total effort by phase
   - Next steps for implementation

## Guidelines

- Prioritization should be driven by business value and user impact
- Consider both dependencies and risks
- Create realistic roadmap phases
- Each phase should deliver cohesive value
- Document trade-offs and rationale for decisions
- Align priorities with PRD goals and success metrics
- Be transparent about what's being deferred and why
