$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

This command reviews RFE artifacts (RFE master list and individual RFE documents) for technical feasibility, implementation readiness, and quality of technical planning.

**IMPORTANT: Agent Collaboration**

You MUST proactively invoke the following collaborating agents to ensure comprehensive RFE review:

1. **@stella-staff_engineer.md** - For technical feasibility, implementation complexity, and risk assessment
2. **@archie-architect.md** (from bullpen) - For architecture alignment and system-level implications
3. **@neil-test_engineer.md** (from bullpen) - For testing requirements, automation strategy, and cross-team impact analysis
4. **@emma-engineering_manager.md** (from bullpen) - For team capacity planning and delivery coordination
5. **@olivia-product_owner.md** (from bullpen) - For acceptance criteria validation and scope negotiation

Invoke these agents at the start of the review process. Work collaboratively with them to validate technical approach, assess testability, check capacity, and ensure architecture alignment.

1. **Load RFE Artifacts**:
   - Read `rfes.md` (required)
   - Read individual RFE files from `rfe-tasks/*.md`
   - Read `prd.md` for context
   - Read `prioritization.md` (if exists)
   - Consider user input from $ARGUMENTS

2. **Create RFE Technical Review Report**: Generate `rfe-review-report.md`:

3. **Perform Technical Feasibility Analysis**:

   For each RFE, systematically evaluate:

   - **Technical Clarity**: How well-defined is the technical approach?
   - **Scope Assessment**: Is the scope realistic and well-bounded?
   - **Dependencies**: Are all technical dependencies identified and manageable?
   - **Risks**: What could go wrong technically? How severe?
   - **Resources**: Are the necessary skills, infrastructure, and services available?
   - **Testing**: Can this be tested effectively? Is the test strategy sound?

4. **Score Each RFE**:
   - Evaluate each category on a 0-10 scale
   - Aggregate scores for overall technical feasibility
   - Identify RFEs that are ready vs. need work vs. blocked

5. **Validate Dependencies**:
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Identify critical path
   - Find opportunities for parallel work
   - Flag dependency risks

6. **Assess Technical Risks**:
   - Identify technical risks in each RFE
   - Look for common risk patterns
   - Evaluate cumulative/systemic risks
   - Propose mitigation strategies

7. **Validate Effort Estimates**:
   - Review sizing estimates against technical complexity
   - Flag underestimated or overestimated RFEs
   - Recommend estimate adjustments
   - Suggest splitting overly large RFEs

8. **Evaluate Implementation Readiness**:
   - Determine which RFEs are ready to start
   - Identify blocking issues
   - List prerequisites for each RFE
   - Provide go/no-go recommendation

9. **Report Findings**:
   - Display technical feasibility scores
   - Highlight critical technical issues
   - List blocked RFEs
   - Provide actionable technical recommendations
   - State readiness for implementation

10. **Interactive Follow-up**:
    - If issues found, ask if user wants to address them
    - Suggest technical planning tasks (spikes, prototypes, research)
    - Offer to help refine RFE technical details
    - Recommend re-running `/rfe.breakdown` if major restructuring needed

## Guidelines

- Focus on technical feasibility and implementation readiness
- Be realistic about technical challenges and risks
- Identify skill gaps, resource needs, and infrastructure requirements
- Check that technical approaches are sound and well-thought-out
- Validate that dependencies are manageable
- Ensure testing strategies are comprehensive
- Flag underestimated complexity early
- Provide constructive technical guidance
- Recommend spikes or prototypes for high-risk areas
- Make clear technical recommendations for each RFE
- Balance thoroughness with pragmatism
- Consider both immediate implementation and long-term maintainability
