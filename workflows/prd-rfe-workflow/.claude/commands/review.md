## Outline

This command reviews all artifacts generated during the PRD-RFE workflow and validates their completeness and quality.

1. **Scan Artifacts Directory**:
   - Check for existence of key artifacts:
     - `artifacts/discovery.md` (optional)
     - `artifacts/requirements.md` (optional)
     - `artifacts/prd.md` (required)
     - `artifacts/rfes.md` (required)
     - `artifacts/rfe-tasks/*.md` (required)
     - `artifacts/prioritization.md` (recommended)

2. **Create Review Report**: Generate `artifacts/review-report.md`:

   ```markdown
   # PRD-RFE Workflow Review Report

   **Date**: [Current Date]
   **Reviewer**: Claude Assistant
   **Status**: [Complete/Incomplete/Needs Revision]

3. **Perform Detailed Quality Checks**:

   ### PRD Review
   - Read `artifacts/prd.md` completely
   - Verify all required sections are present
   - Check that success metrics are measurable
   - Ensure requirements are testable
   - Validate that scope is clearly defined
   - Look for contradictions or ambiguities

   ### RFE Review
   - Read `artifacts/rfes.md` and sample individual RFE files
   - Verify all PRD requirements are covered
   - Check that each RFE has acceptance criteria
   - Validate dependencies are documented
   - Ensure sizing is reasonable
   - Look for gaps or overlaps

   ### Prioritization Review (if exists)
   - Read `artifacts/prioritization.md`
   - Verify prioritization method is clear
   - Check alignment with business goals
   - Validate roadmap phases are logical
   - Ensure dependencies are respected

4. **Generate Traceability Report**:
   - Map each PRD requirement to covering RFEs
   - Identify any requirements not covered by RFEs
   - Identify any RFEs not traceable to PRD
   - Create matrix showing relationships

5. **Calculate Quality Scores**:
   - PRD quality score (completeness, clarity, consistency)
   - RFE quality score (coverage, sizing, dependencies)
   - Prioritization quality score (methodology, alignment, roadmap)
   - Overall workflow quality score

6. **Identify Issues and Recommendations**:
   - Flag critical gaps or problems
   - Suggest improvements
   - Recommend next steps
   - Prioritize action items

7. **Report Completion**:
   - Display summary of review findings
   - Highlight quality scores
   - List critical issues
   - Provide recommendations
   - State readiness for next phase

8. **Interactive Review** (if issues found):
   - Ask user if they want to address issues now
   - Offer to re-run specific commands to fix problems
   - Suggest which artifacts need revision

## Guidelines

- Be thorough but constructive in review
- Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Focus on completeness, clarity, and consistency
- Check traceability from PRD to RFEs
- Validate that all artifacts align with business goals
- Ensure documentation is ready for stakeholder review
