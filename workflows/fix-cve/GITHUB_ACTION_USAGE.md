# Using the CVE Fix Workflow as a GitHub Action

This guide explains how to use the CVE Fix Workflow as a **reusable GitHub Action** in any repository.

## 🎯 Overview

The CVE Fix Workflow is now available as a **reusable GitHub Actions workflow** that any repository can import and use with a single line of code.

**No code duplication needed!** All repositories reference the same workflow from the central `acp-workflows` repository.

## 📦 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Workflow to Your Repository

Create `.github/workflows/cve-scan.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: CVE Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 1 * *'  # Monthly on 1st at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger

jobs:
  cve-fix:
    uses: YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows/.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml@main
    with:
      create_pr: true
      severity_threshold: 'HIGH'
      target_branch: 'main'
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
```

**That's it!** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select: **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Enable: **"Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests"**
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test It

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **"CVE Scan"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Watch the 7 phases execute automatically

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
jobs:
  cve-fix:
    uses: YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows/.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml@main
    with:
      create_pr: true              # Auto-create PR with fixes
      severity_threshold: 'HIGH'    # Minimum severity: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
      target_branch: 'main'         # Branch to create PR against
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
jobs:
  cve-fix:
    uses: YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows/.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml@main
    with:
      create_pr: true
      severity_threshold: 'CRITICAL'  # Only critical CVEs
      target_branch: 'develop'        # Target develop branch
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      security-events: write    # For SARIF upload
```

### Schedule Options

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Run monthly
    - cron: '0 2 1 * *'

    # Or run weekly
    # - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 2 AM

    # Or run daily
    # - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Every day at 2 AM

  # Allow manual runs
  workflow_dispatch:
```

## 📊 Workflow Outputs

The workflow provides outputs you can use:

```yaml
jobs:
  cve-fix:
    uses: YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows/.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml@main
    # ... configuration ...

  notify:
    needs: cve-fix
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Send notification
        run: |
          echo "CVEs found: ${{ needs.cve-fix.outputs.cves_found }}"
          echo "PR URL: ${{ needs.cve-fix.outputs.pr_url }}"
```

**Available outputs:**
- `cves_found` - Number of CVEs detected
- `pr_url` - Pull request URL (if created)

## 📁 What Gets Created

When the workflow runs, it automatically:

### 1. Artifacts (Downloadable)
```
artifacts/
├── reports/           # Scan results (npm, pip, trivy)
├── analysis/          # Severity analysis
├── review/            # Release documentation review
├── remediation/       # Fix logs
├── testing/           # Test results
├── verification/      # Re-scan results
└── docs/              # Executive summary
```

### 2. Pull Request (if fixes available)
- **Title:** "Security: CVE Fixes - [Month Year]"
- **Labels:** security, cve-fix, automated
- **Body:** Executive summary with all details

### 3. Issue (if no automatic fixes)
- **Title:** "CVE Scan Complete - Manual Review Required"
- **Labels:** security, manual-review
- **Body:** Link to scan results

## 🌟 Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ No Code Duplication
- **Single source of truth** in `acp-workflows` repository
- All repositories reference the same workflow
- Updates to workflow automatically apply to all users

### ✅ Easy to Use
- Add 1 file to any repository
- 20 lines of YAML
- No scripts to maintain

### ✅ Centralized Updates
- Fix bugs in one place
- Add features once, everyone benefits
- Version pinning available (`@main`, `@v1`, etc.)

### ✅ Consistent Results
- Same scanning tools across all repos
- Same 7-phase methodology
- Same reporting format

## 📖 Examples

### Example 1: Node.js Project

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cve-scan.yml
name: Monthly Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 1 * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    uses: YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows/.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml@main
    with:
      create_pr: true
      severity_threshold: 'HIGH'
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
```

### Example 2: Python Project

Same configuration! The workflow automatically detects project type and uses appropriate tools.

### Example 3: Multiple Languages

Works automatically! Scans Node.js, Python, Docker, and more in the same run.

### Example 4: Custom Branch Strategy

```yaml
jobs:
  cve-scan:
    uses: YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows/.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml@main
    with:
      create_pr: true
      severity_threshold: 'CRITICAL'
      target_branch: 'develop'  # Create PR against develop
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Required Permissions

The workflow needs:
- `contents: write` - To push fix branches
- `pull-requests: write` - To create PRs
- `issues: write` - To create issues

### Private Repositories

For private repos:
1. The `acp-workflows` repository can be public (workflow is public)
2. Your repository can be private (scanned repo is private)
3. The workflow runs in YOUR repository's context with YOUR secrets

### Public Repositories

Works out of the box with no additional configuration.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Resource not accessible by integration"

**Problem:** Workflow can't create PRs

**Solution:** Enable workflow permissions:
1. Settings → Actions → General
2. Workflow permissions → "Read and write"
3. Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create PRs"

### "Workflow not found"

**Problem:** Can't find the reusable workflow

**Solution:** Check:
1. Repository name is correct (`YOUR_USERNAME/acp-workflows`)
2. Path is correct (`.github/workflows/cve-fix-workflow.yml`)
3. Branch/tag is correct (`@main`)
4. Repository is accessible (public or you have access)

### No CVEs Found

**Problem:** Scan completes but finds 0 CVEs

**Solution:**
- Your dependencies are up to date! ✅
- Or check scan logs for errors
- Try lowering severity threshold: `severity_threshold: 'MEDIUM'`
